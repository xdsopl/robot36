Always wanted to write an Android version of Robot36 the moment i got an Android device.
This way i would be able to show off to my friends on the go :)
Finally took the time to write this prototype in 2 weekends worth of time.
I intentionally wrote this (painfully) in Android Studio (not really an IDE using guy) so that others (that means YOU) can start developing using this and eventually contribute.
Also wanted to try something new, so instead of using an complex FIR filter i used an complex cascaded exponential moving average filter after mixing.

And again, i would like to thank JL Barber (N7CXI) for the specifications in his "Dayton Paper".
I also would like to thank the RenderScript developers, as their work made the implementation of Robot36's decoder almost effortless.
I would like to keep the name Robot36 even since Robot36 is able to decode more than just Robot36 as a great respect for the Robot engineers who developed the awesome Robot36 mode.

Currently the following modes are supported:

Robot Modes: 36 & 72
Martin Modes: 1 & 2
Scottie Modes: 1, 2 & DX
Wrasse Modes: SC2 180

Watching of old B/W or unsupported transmission modes works even in the "Raw Mode".

I created the "Robot36 SSTV Alpha Testers" Community, which you can join and help test prebuilt apk's from the Google Play Store for free:

https://plus.google.com/communities/106204623850343150882

Robot36 will remain free, but i really would like to get some direct feedback over issues before releasing it to a broader audience on the Google Play Store.
